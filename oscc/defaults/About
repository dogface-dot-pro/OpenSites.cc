<p>You can write about yourself here! Tell the Internet a little about who you are, what you do, what you like and what you can offer.</p>

<hr>

<p>You might also want to write a little about your site, and explain the things that are on it.</p>

<p>To get started, just push 'Edit page', at the bottom of that navigation menu on the left there!</p>

<p>Once you're editing a page, you can push the same button again (well, it'll be called 'Edit site') to edit the whole site - add new pages, remove them, change the settings... go nuts!</p>

<p>Remember to write in HTML though!</p>
