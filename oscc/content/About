<p>I'm currently learning web development as part of a change in careers. This website is mostly here for me to practise on! At the moment I'm making it in vanilla PHP and mySQL, and I may soon switch to using <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually I'll move to a mostly Javascript-based environment, using things like node.js, express.js, knockout.js, and jQuery. I really like <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>! At some point I'll probably spend some time learning Ruby and Python. I'm also studying some other miscellaneous stuff like Photoshop/Illustrator and other art programs, CMR databases and VBscript, etc.</p>

<p>I'm interested in game design. Once I've built up a solid base of coding experience I'll look into the more formal side of that, but in the meantime I'm keen to make web-based games based on co-operation, persistant multi-user experience, mystery and creativity. And some other stuff!</p>
