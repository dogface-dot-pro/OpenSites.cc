<p>Now you have a website!</p>

<p>You can edit this page by pushing 'Edit page', over there on the left. Or you can click 'Edit Site' to add/delete/move/rename pages, or change the site settings.</p>

<p>You should go and <a href="?page=Edit_Site">do that now</a>, so you can set a password! If you set it to <code>default</code>, like it is now, then anyone can edit the site without having to login.</p>
